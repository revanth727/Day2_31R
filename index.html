<h4>HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</center></h4><hr>
<b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b> is the standard <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language" target = "_blank"> markup language[a]</a> for documents designed to be displayed in a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser"  target = "_blank"> web browser</a>.It defines the content and structure of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content" target = "_blank">web content.</a>. It is often assisted by technologies such as <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target = "_blank">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language" target = "_blank">scripting languages</a> such as <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target = "_blank"> JavaScript</a>, a programming language.<br> <br>
<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser" target = "_blank">Web browsers</a> receive HTML documents from a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server" target = "_blank">web server</a> or from local storage and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_engine" target = "_blank"> render</a> the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page" target = "_blank">web page</a> <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web" target = "_blank">semantically</a> and originally included cues for its appearance.<br> <br>
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element" target = "_blank">HTML elements</a> are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Images_and_objects" target = "_blank">images</a> and other objects such as <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Forms" target = "_blank">interactive forms</a> may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_document" target = "_blank">structured documents</a> by denoting structural <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics" target = "_blank">semantics</a> for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink" target = "_blank">links</a>, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket#Angle_brackets" target = "_blank">angle brackets</a>. Tags such as &lt;img&gt; and &lt;input&gt; directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser" target = "_blank">Browsers</a> do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.<br> <br>
HTML can embed programs written in a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language" target = "_blank">scripting language</a> such as <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target = "_blank">JavaScript</a>, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium" target = "_blank">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>, former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target = "_blank">CSS</a>standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[3] A form of HTML, known as <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5" target = "_blank">HTML5</a>, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the &lt;canvas&gt; element, together with JavaScript.
